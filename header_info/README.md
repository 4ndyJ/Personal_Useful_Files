# Header infomation lookup
Within is the description found in the headers of the JWST .fits files, I intend to add a column to explain the keywords in words I can explain and use as a search tool.

## Calling different headers
`ext = 0; extname = "PRIMARY"`\
`ext = 1; extname = "SCI"`\
`ext = 2; extname = "REFOUT"`\
`ext = 3; extname = "GROUP"`\
`ext = 4; extname = "INT_IMTES"`\
`ext = 5; extname = "ASDF"`
